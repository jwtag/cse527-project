# What is this subdirectory?

The files here are for handling the "granular" model, which takes in separate CSV files for each drug category.

Patients in each dataset are not necessarily in the other datasets.

This model should be better for general drug prediction.

The data files were derived from files obtained from Stanford here:  https://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/geno-rx-datasets.html
